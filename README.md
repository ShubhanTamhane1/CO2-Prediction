## ðŸš— COâ‚‚ Emissions Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

This project leverages a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict the amount of **COâ‚‚** emissions a car produces based on key vehicle features. The model utilizes data points such as engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and mileage (mpg) to generate accurate predictions. Additionally, **ggplot2** is used for data visualization, helping uncover hidden trends and patterns in vehicle emissions.

This model has significant applications in both the **automotive industry** (for fuel efficiency and emissions optimization) and the **environmental sector** (for regulatory compliance and sustainability initiatives).
