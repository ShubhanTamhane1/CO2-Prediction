## ðŸš— CO2 Emissions Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor

This project leverages a Random Forest Regressor to predict the amount of COâ‚‚ emissions a car produces based on key vehicle features. The model utilizes data points such as engine size, fuel type, transmission type, and mileage (mpg) to generate accurate predictions. Additionally, ggplot2 is used for data visualization, helping uncover hidden trends and patterns in vehicle emissions.
This model has significant applications in both the automotive industry (for fuel efficiency and emissions optimization) and the environmental sector (for regulatory compliance and sustainability initiatives).
